# sortext

![GHA workflow badge](https://github.com/samusyrjanen/sortext/workflows/CI/badge.svg) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/samusyrjanen/sortext/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=TMTGIKOD27)](https://codecov.io/gh/samusyrjanen/sortext)

This is a text sorting app. The app uses a dataset of old bbc news articles, and takes additional news articles as an input. The news articles are converted into a matrix, which indicates the importance of each word in an article, and it sorts those articles into similar groups using k-means clustering algorithm. The resulting clusters contain similar texts, and they can be browsed.
