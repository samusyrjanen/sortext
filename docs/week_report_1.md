## The First Days

I began planning my topic a week before the official course start. I wanted to make an app that could analyze text based content at least somewhat intelligently. First, I explored the idea of making the app categorize a news article into negative, neutral, or positive category based on its sentiment. For this task I would have used a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. However, SVM turned out to be more complex than I anticipated, and I decided to think of a slightly new topic.

At the start of this week, I began exploring the possibility to use an easier, k-means clustering algorithm to categorize the news articles. Although this method is unable to categorize articles into predetermined categories, it was easier to implement than SVM, and it uses unsupervised learning instead of supervised learning, making it easier to find desired training data. For this algorithm, the text data would need to be processed into a k-means-friendly form. This meant yet more planning and reading.

After couple days of research, I felt confident enough that I could learn the necessary skills to carry out my planned topic. In wednesday afternoon I wrote the specifications about the project, and joined the course's Labtool page. At this point, the [specification.md](docs/specification.md) is a good summary of my learning.

### Thursday 18.5.


In thursday morning I began writing this document, reflecting what I had done in the passed days. At this point almost everything is ready to start the actual creation of the app. The first thing I will start by is creating a good environment for the codebase and plan the structure and order, by which I will start the development.
